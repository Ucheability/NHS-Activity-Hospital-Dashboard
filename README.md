Excel dashboard analysing NHS hospital activity, admissions, bed days, and specialty performance (2024–25)

# National Hospital Activity & Performance Overview (2024–25)

## 1. Project Overview

This project provides an analytical overview of NHS hospital activity and performance for the 2024–25 financial year. Using national-level hospital episode statistics (HES), the dashboard examines patterns in admissions, bed utilisation, day case activity, and specialty-level workload.
The objective of the dashboard is to support data-driven decision-making by offering clear visibility into hospital demand, operational pressure, and variation across providers and specialties. The analysis is designed for use by healthcare managers, analysts, and policy stakeholders to monitor performance and identify areas for improvement.
## 2. Business Questions

The dashboard was designed to answer the following key business and operational questions:

- What is the total volume of hospital admissions across England during the 2024–25 period?
- How is activity distributed between inpatient admissions and day case activity?
- Which clinical specialties account for the highest levels of hospital activity?
- How does bed utilisation vary across providers and specialties?
- Where are potential operational pressures or inefficiencies within hospital services?
