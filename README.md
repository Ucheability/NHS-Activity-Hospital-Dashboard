# NHS-Activity-Hospital-Dashboard
Excel dashboard analysing NHS hospital activity, admissions, bed days, and specialty performance (2024–25)

# National Hospital Activity & Performance Overview (2024–25)

## 1. Project Overview

This project provides an analytical overview of NHS hospital activity and performance for the 2024–25 financial year. Using national-level hospital episode statistics (HES), the dashboard examines patterns in admissions, bed utilisation, day case activity, and specialty-level workload.
The objective of the dashboard is to support data-driven decision-making by offering clear visibility into hospital demand, operational pressure, and variation across providers and specialties. The analysis is designed for use by healthcare managers, analysts, and policy stakeholders to monitor performance and identify areas for improvement.
## 2. Business Questions

The dashboard was designed to answer the following key business and operational questions:

- What is the total volume of hospital admissions across England during the 2024–25 period?
- How is activity distributed between inpatient admissions and day case activity?
- Which clinical specialties account for the highest levels of hospital activity?
- How does bed utilisation vary across providers and specialties?
- Where are potential operational pressures or inefficiencies within hospital services?

## 3. Data Source
- **Source:** The analysis is based on publicly available NHS Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data/ NHS Digital portal for the 2024–25 financial year. The dataset contains aggregated information on hospital activity across England, including admissions, finished consultant episodes (FCEs), bed days, day case activity, and specialty-level breakdowns.
- **Governance Note:** To preserve data integrity while maintaining patient confidentiality, suppressed values within the HES dataset were imputed using a conservative proxy approach to enable consistent aggregation at national and regional levels.

## 4. Key KPIs
The dashboard focuses on the following key performance indicators (KPIs):

- **Total Admissions** (Finished Admission Episodes – FAE)
- **Day Case Activity**  (Finished Consultant Episodes – FCE)
- **Total No of NHS Porviders**
- **Average Length of Stay (ALOS)**
- **Day Case Rate (%)**

## 5. Dashboard Design

The dashboard was designed in Excel with a clear, user-focused layout to support quick interpretation and exploration of hospital activity data.

**Key design features include:**
- High-level KPI cards summarising admissions, bed days, and length of stay
- Comparative visualisations showing inpatient activity versus day case activity
- Specialty-level charts highlighting areas of highest demand
- Provider-level analysis to support benchmarking and performance comparison
- Interactive slicers enabling users to filter results by provider and specialty
